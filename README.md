# Flask based Porfolio

I needed a new porfolio to replace my out of date Django and Bootstrap based portfolio.

My goals are to reduce my codebase and build a small porfolio app with Flask.

I will be using React for the front end and let Flask handle everything in the backend.

This app will have a short porfolio section which will show off the latest projects that I have completed and launched and give a small blurb on what technologies I used what I've learned.  In addition, I'd like to have a small photo stream somewhere to get my content from my Instagram accounts to show off what I do in my free time.  Perhaps, I'll add in a short blog section for me to add my random thoughts.
